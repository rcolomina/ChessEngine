# ChessEngine
Project dedicated to rebuild an old chess engine written entirely in C language. It will be desirable to rewrite the engine logic. Currently, the logic is placed basically under function, which manipulates basic data types structures. It would be good move all the code into structures or classes. Due to the code is very coupled, this makes very difficult testing small parts of the program.
